# Clustering_Safest_District

The goal of this project is to find the safest district in London based on the [crime data](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/london-crime) and cluster the safest district with K means clustering algorithm. To do so, neighborhoods around the district and their top venues will be explored with foursquare API; later they will be clustered.
